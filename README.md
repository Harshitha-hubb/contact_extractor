# Contact Extractor with Click-to-Call Support

A smart contact extraction tool built for internal support teams to quickly extract and call leads or contact points from any website. This tool automatically pulls emails, mobile numbers, and landline numbers, stores them in a database, and enables click-to-call through the Knowlarity API â€” streamlining communication without manual copying or switching platforms.
